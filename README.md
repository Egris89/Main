Rotary Delta Printer,

inspired by the Icepick Delta Project this is my latest Version of a Rotary Delta. Most of the Parts are printed. You need a workspace of 300x300mm to be able to print all Parts.

I used PETG as material and an infill-ratio of 50% with 4 Perimeters and 4 Top & Bottom Layers. You should be familiar in using manuel placed supports. I oriented the STL files as I printed them. I recommend to alaign your Printer as good as possible in X/Y/Z orientation because this will have an effect to the accuracy of the machine.

 

You will need following Parts for the assambly:

-> Bearing 608ZZ  18x

-> Bearing 696ZZ  18x

-> Shaft, Diameter 6mm, length 52mm    6x

-> Shaft, Diameter 8mm, length 82mm    3x

-> Shaft, Diameter 8mm, lenght 145mm   3x

-> Hexagonal Spacers, lenght 20mm, M4

-> Carbon Rod, Diameter 30mm, Inner Diameter 28mm, lenght 173mm, 3 pieces

-> Carbon Rod, Diameter 8mm, lenght 375mm, 6 pieces

-> 11mm Steel Balls with M4 Threads

-> Opto Endstops

-> Super-Glue

-> Nema 17

-> HTD 3M 9mm Pulley, 40 teeth  3x

-> HTD 3M 9mm Pulley, 20 teeth 3x

-> HTD 3M 9mm Pulley, 14 teeth 3x

-> HTD 3M 9mm Belts,

-> HTD 3M closed belt with 174 theeth, 3x

-> Aluminium-Shaft, Diameter 28mm, Lenght 122mm, M5 Threads on Bottom & Top

 

Some Values for FW-Setup:

Base-Radius: 80mm

Effector-Radius: 35mm

Arm-Lenght: 190mm

Rod-Lenght: 394mm

Angle when homed: about 46.50°  (When you measure the arm-angle on bottom of the Carbon-Rod you have to substract 7.9° to get the correct angle)

Stepps per deg with x32 Micro-Stepping and 1.8° Stepper: 391
